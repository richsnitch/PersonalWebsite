# rich7524.github.io
In Fall of 2022, I took CISC 375, Web Development. The beginning of the course focused entirely on the foundations of building a webpage. HTML is a markup language used in front-end work to display content on a web browser, while CSS is a styling language. We focused on learning the basics of HTML and CSS as a long introduction to the class, which was reflected in the creation of our own personal website. For this personal website, the primary goal was for us to become familiar with the two languages. I started by creating an index page that I used to give a brief introduction to myself. Then, I added a navigation bar to the top, with buttons that allowed you to switch between webpages. Those webpages included 'resume.html', 'projects.html', and 'fun.html'. The project was relatively open-ended, giving me the opportunity to style and write however I pleased. When I felt it was necessary, I added hyperlinks that would bring the user to other pages outside of my website. Photos, uniquely styled text, borders, and color schemes were all stylistic changes that I added with my knowledge of CSS. To run the program, you can type 'rich7524.github.io' in the nav bar at the top of your browser, and it will bring you to the webpage.
